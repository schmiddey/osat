Open Source Airsoft Target, WLAN-based Smart Target System

# Overview
The idea of the target system is, that you have one base station (Raspi Pi as WLAN AP) and many target satelites.
The Targets contain a Wemos D1 mini, a Neopixel LED, and a Piezo sensor behind a Polycarbonate plate.

More info is coming !!!

# Process
Currently only the firmware and maybe the hardware is ready or alpha state :)

The Software for the Raspi has to be done next.

note: this was my first try in hardware desigen (KiCAD) and CAD (OpenSCAD) so lets see :)
